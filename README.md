AUTOMACS
========

The "automacs" codes are designed to efficiently, 
reproducibly generate molecular dynamics simulations 
of biophysical systems along with clear documentation
of each simulation. This software is maintained on the
[github](https://github.com/biophyscode/automacs).

Requires
--------

	1. Python version 2.7 or higher
	2. GROMACS (any version)
	3. Sphinx to generate python HTML documentation
	
Installation
------------

Download and run ``make help`` for instructions.
If sphinx is available, run ``make docs`` to compile
a local copy of the HTML documentation. AUTOMACS
is meant to be cloned once for each simulation so
that the code accompanies the data.

Modifications
-------------

Send a message to [BioPhysCode](mailto:biophyscode@gmail.com) if
you need help implementing this code or you would like to 
add a feature.
