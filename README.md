AUTOMACS /// AMX
================

The "automacs" codes are designed to efficiently, 
reproducibly generate molecular dynamics simulations 
of biophysical systems along with clear documentation
of each simulation. This software is maintained on the
[github](https://github.com/bradleyrp/automacs).

Requires
--------

	1. Python version 2.7 or higher.
	2. The PyYaml package for interpreting settings.
	4. Sphinx python documentation generator (documentation).
	
Installation
------------

Download and run ``make help`` for instructions.
If sphinx is available, run ``make docs`` to compile
a local copy of the HTML documentation. AUTOMACS
is meant to be cloned once for each simulation so
that the code accompanies the data.

Modifications
-------------

Send a message to [Ryan Bradley](mailto:bradleyrp@gmail.com) if
you need help implementing this code or you would like to 
add a feature.
